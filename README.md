# Sports-Site-Vue
I created a sports website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vue. I also developed a custom dashboard that includes the following features: Posts, Pages, Notifications, Users, Administrators, Tags, Categories, Messages, and Settings. Additionally, I designed a UI to display all the data and used a JSON server to store the data
